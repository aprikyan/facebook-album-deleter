# A short snippet that *(still)* works

1. Sign into your profile and open an album you'd like to delete,

2. Open Developer Tools > Console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` on Chrome, Windows),

3. Paste the `main.js` and press enter,

4. Proceed to your work, while keeping the tab open in your browser.

Note: the code works with the new Facebook design only, as for 2020 October. Unless Zuck changes the design/structure again, this will work.
